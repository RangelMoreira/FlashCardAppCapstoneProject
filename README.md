# Flash Card App Capstone Project


# About the project

Do you want to learn French in a fun and efficient way?

This is a project developed in the course 'Master Python by Building 100 Projects' to help English speakers learn French.

The software presents cards containing words in French, for the user to select whether they know or do not know them. If the user does not know the word, the word will be kept in a csv file of words to be studied. If the user does know the word, the word will be removed.

If the user does not select the word as known or unknown within 30 seconds, the translation will be displayed.
